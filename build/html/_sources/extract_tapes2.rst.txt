Extract Data from the Tapes
===========================

1. First you will have to check if the tape machine is ready.

→ Log into the LTO computer with:

::

    ssh sat\_data\@lto5.tropos.de
    (password: **AbS11!**)

→ check the status with:

::

    mtx -f /dev/sg1 status

→ The data transfer element has to be empty. |Image 1|

If this isn't the case you have to unload it with:

::

    mtx -f /dev/sg1 unload

2. Ask Hartwig for the key to access the server-room in building 23.5.

3. Use room **0.03** in the ground floor of 23.5 to access room
   **0.07**. Here you will find the rack with the tape-computer and
   tape-drive right next to the door.

4. At the tape-computer use the Next (►) or Previous key (◄) to navigate
   to "Operations". Use Enter to get to the selection of which of the
   two magazines (each holding up to 4 tapes) you like to open.

Either use Enter again on "Unlock Left Magazine" or "Unlock Right
Magazine" and wait a brief moment.

5. Kindly remove the unlocked magazine and insert or exchange tape(s).
   Always start with #1 (nearest position in the left magazine).

**Note** The left magazine contains: *Positions 1* to *4* (starting with
#1)

and the right magazine contains: *Position 5* to *8* (starting with #5)

6. Re-insert the magazine and wait for the tape-computer to read the
   tape.

7. Turn off the light, leave the room and lock the door.

8. Give the key back to Hartwig.

9. Log into the LTO computer again

10. Go to the directory for tapes with:

::

    cd /vols/talos/datasets/eumcst/incoming/umarf/tapes

Execute the shell-script **extract\_tape** for a single tape in *Positio
1*:

::

    nohup extract\_tape.sh \$TAPENAME &

or the shell script **extract\_tapes** for multiple tapes:

::

    nohup extract\_tapes.sh \$TAPE1NAME \$TAPE2NAME \$TAPE3NAME &

For the tape names you can simply use ``mtx -f /dev/sg1 status`` again,
it shows them after VolumeTag=, remember to follow the position order.

**Note**: nohup lets you run programs even if you log out and writes any
messages into the file nohup.out.

11. Now the data for Step III should be under:

::

    /vols/talos/datasets/eumcst/incoming/umarf/tapes/(tapename)

12. Unlike the http files the tape files don't need to be unpacked,
    simply add them to the target folder:

::

    /vols/altair/datasets/eumcst/incoming/umarf/http/(year)

**Note:** It can be useful to look into linux tape management to
understand the process and solve possibly occurring errors.
